what is the differnece between different metrics types ( counter , gauge , histogram)?

Counter
A counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart.
For example, you can use a counter to represent the number of requests served, tasks completed, or errors.

Gauge
A gauge is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down

Histogram
A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets.
It also provides a sum of all observed values.
