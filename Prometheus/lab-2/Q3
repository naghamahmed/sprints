What is the maximum retention period to save data in Prometheus and how to increase it ?

By default the retention is configured to 15 days. The amounts of data stored on disk depends on retention

Increase it:
- In the management node, open the /etc/sysconfig/prometheus file to edit.
- set the needed retention period for the STORAGE_RETENTION option, and then save your changes. For example:

  STORAGE_RETENTION="--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d"

- Restart the Prometheus service:

  systemctl restart prometheus.service
