what is different between hosted, proxy, and group repos ?

Proxy Repository

is a repository that is linked to a remote repository.
Any request for a component is verified against the local content of the proxy repository.
If no local component is found, the request is forwarded to the remote repository. 
The component is then retrieved and stored locally in the repository manager,
which acts as a cache. Subsequent requests for the same component are then fulfilled from the local storage, 
therefore eliminating the network bandwidth and time overhead of retrieving the component from the remote repository again.

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured proxy repositories:
- maven-central
- nuget.org-proxy

Hosted Repository

is a repository that stores components in the repository manager as the authoritative location for these components.
By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured hosted repositories:
- maven-releases
- maven-snapshots
- nuget-hosted


Repository Group

They allow you to combine multiple repositories and other repository groups in a single repository.
This in turn means that your users can rely on a single URL for their configuration needs,
while the administrators can add more repositories and therefore components to the repository group.
