in brief write about importance of nexus ?

Nexus Repository Manager provides a central platform for storing build artifacts,
saving us significant maintenance and hardware costs. I am very confident of its reliability.
The main features of Nexus Repository are its ability to proxy, host, and manage software artifacts.
It can serve as a central point for all of the artifacts that your team needs, and it can help to keep track of versions and dependencies. Additionally,
Nexus Repository can help to speed up build times by caching frequently-used artifacts.
